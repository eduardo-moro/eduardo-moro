### Dear recruiter, let's talk a bit about my carrer:

I started in the programming area in 2019, when I was accepted on UFPR, I had already tried my luck in game development, 
with java and C#, and made a high school project using arduino to feed a tesla coil that plays music, but nothing of 
that came close to the world that opened up in front of me that year, and what a crazy year was that.

I started by learning Pascal, I always heard complaints from my class colleagues because we were learning a language 
"so outdated", many complain to this day that they wish they had learned python, js, or some other newer language, 
I will never understand this feeling, Pascal has been for almost 20 years one of the most used languages in the world, 
it works, it does what it is expected to do, and it has been very useful for a lot of people, and from that point on, 
what matters to me is not language, but the problems it can solve, if I don't know a language, and it has a logic 
different from everything I know, my impetus is to study, until I master it.

I had a little help to get my first internship, an indication, the system was big, and made in a framework I never heard
before, YII, which is already old, but does what it needs, is up to date and relatively safe, it was not easy to learn 
it at first, I didn't know much about PHP yet, but I learned, after 6 months I was able to deliver most of my tasks, and
I had learned to ask for help.

I joined my second company in 2020, after Brazil allow home office for interns, after a week I was hired as junior, in
that company I learned VUE, lumen, improved my knowledge with git, and learned infinite new things, including computer
vision, I made some facial and hand tracking with python, and this is what makes me passionate about technology, 
learning, improving all the time, and being able to help someone with my work.

I started doing freelance work in 2021, so I left my job, to keep myself completely at home, and seek new challenges,
I worked at Ecritel do Brasil, working with modern frontend technologies such Vue3 and nuxt, working with the creation 
of pixel perfect interfaces, until I received my first proposal to work to a company overseas.

I worked for 7 months in Mavtek, Learned a lot with my senior colleagues. In Mavtek I was part of the team that keeps 
the legacy running, we made updates and integrated the legacy systems to the new ones, the experiente of only speaking 
english the whole day and learning a whole new work culture was awesome and surely I will keep this experience for the
rest of my life.

I got back to quadritech, working on innovation projects mainly using c#, dotnet, python and c++, creating a windows 
program that reads fingerprints, signature and picture of people and searches this data to recognize people, this program
is going to be used by brazilian federal organs, also I made researches on risc-V based boards such as k210 and esp32
for embedded code projects, creating micro AI's and LVGL 7 interfaces.

I am currently looking for another opportunity to create innovation and make the difference as much as I can!
I love working with different technologies and to be challenged everyday,so if you are a recruiter and got interested 
for my profile, please reach me out :)
