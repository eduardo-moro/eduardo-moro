    <h4>
        Fullstack developer
    </h4>
    <p> I'm a developer since 2019, and I work with what I love! </p>
    <p> In my opinion, no matter the language (exept java), what matters is the desired result, technology is a tool and I love to learn how to master them.</p>
    <p> I'm currently on "anÃ¡lise e desenvolvimento de sistemas" on UFPR - Universidade Federal do ParanÃ¡ </p>
    <p> I love programming, for me, there is no bug that can't be solved after a good coffee mug and half an hour of studies.</p>

    <summary>Let's talk a bit about my carrer:</summary>
    <br>
    <p>I started in the programming area in 2019, when I was accepted on UFPR, I had already tried my luck in game development, with java and C#, and made a high school project using arduino to feed a tesla coil that plays music, but nothing of that came close to the world that opened up in front of me that year, and what a crazy year was that.</p>
    <p>I started by learning Pascal, I always heard complaints from my class colleagues because we were learning a language "so outdated", many complain to this day that they wish they had learned python, js, or some other newer language, I will never understand this feeling, Pascal has been for almost 20 years one of the most used languages in the world, it works, it does what it is expected to do, and it has been very useful for a lot of people, and from that point on, what matters to me is not language, but the problems it can solve, if I don't know a language, and it has a logic different from everything I know, my impetus is to study, until I master it.</p>
    <p>I had a little help to get my first internship, an indication, the system was big, and made in a framework I never heard before, YII, which is already old, but does what it needs, is up to date and relatively safe, it was not easy to learn it at first, I didn't know much about PHP yet, but I learned, after 6 months I was able to deliver most of my tasks, and I had learned to ask for help.</p>
    <p>I joined my second company in 2020, after Brazil allow home office for interns, after a week I was hired as junior, in that company I learned VUE, lumen, improved my knowledge with git, and learned infinite new things, including computer vision, I made some facial and hand tracking with python, and this is what makes me passionate about technology, learning, improving all the time, and being able to help someone with my work.</p>
    <p>I started doing freelance work in 2021, so I left my job, to keep myself completely at home, and seek new challenges,</p>
    <p>I worked at Ecritel do Brasil, working with modern technologies, Vue3 and nuxt, working with the creation of pixel perfect interfaces, until I received my first proposal for foreign countries.</p>
    <p>I'm currently at MAVTEK, an incredible company with incredible colleagues as well, I'm working with the good old PHP, the environment is very relaxed, very different from any experience here in Brazil, and I'm still learning to deal with so much cultural difference, but it's an amazing experience</p>
